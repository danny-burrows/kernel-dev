# Dragoon
This is the first "kernel" I've written and I've learned a lot from it. Its very very simple, it just boots up and prints some text to the screen but its taught a lot about the background to beginning to write a kernel. Since the first draft I've switched the makefile to compile the c file using a i686-elf-gcc 32bit cross compiler. :)
